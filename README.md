# Computer vision toolkit
## Requirement

Use the package manager [pip] to install:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Description
this is a website to help in preprocessing techniques and the perpetuation of the image for computer vision applications, which consist of:

- Implementation for various image processing andcomputer vision algorithms from scratch with python.

- Algorithms implemented from scratch: Edge detection, spatial and frequency domain filtering, active contour, Chain code, Hough transform, SIFT feature extraction, Image segmentation: K-mean, mean-shift, region growing.

- Face Detection and Face Recognition.
